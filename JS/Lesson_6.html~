	  //because we don't know the value we initialize it with 0

	  //Take note: multiplication is in brackets because it has to be

	  //performed before subtraction (remember the good old school math?)

	  //this technique is useful when you have long text strings to manipulate

	  infoText += " instead of at $" + total;
